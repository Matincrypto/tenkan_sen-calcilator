Tenkan-sen is one of the key lines used in technical analysis, particularly in the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator. It represents the average of the high and low prices over the past 9 days.

The formula for calculating Tenkan-sen is as follows:
Tenkan-sen = (High price of the current day + Low price of the current day) / 2

This line is an important component in technical analysis and can be used as an indicator to identify price trends and entry/exit points in trading. It is part of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator which is widely used by traders to make informed decisions in the financial markets. 

Here is a pseudo code example to calculate Tenkan-sen:
```python
def calculate_tenkan_sen(high_prices, low_prices):
    tenkan_sen = (high_prices[-1] + low_prices[-1]) / 2
    return tenkan_sen
```

This line serves as a valuable tool for traders to analyze market trends and make informed trading decisions based on price movements.
